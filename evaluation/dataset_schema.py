"""Typed data contracts for NL-to-SPARQL evaluation.

This module defines the JSON shape for evaluation datasets and for the result
artifacts written after an experiment run. The rest of the evaluation package
uses these models to keep file I/O, scoring, and reporting aligned.

The input side is `EvaluationDataset`, which contains many
`EvaluationQuestion` records. The output side is `ExperimentRun`, which contains
one `QuestionResult` per question plus the runtime configuration used for the
run.
